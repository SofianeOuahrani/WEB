Assignement pour le 9/11 - OUAHRANI Sofiane &amp; BENSALLAH Younes

**ASSIGNMENT FOR NEXT WEEK**
Spend some time on the last example. Learn from it. Be ready to reuse / refactor some code from this example and use it in your own project. Your work is to start making a sampler inspired by the WAM plugin sampler you saw in Example4 in this folder.

**What I'm expecting:**

A real project split into files with some design work (classes etc.)
Start from your solution to Exercice 3 and try to merge what you saw in the last example of Exercice 5 : use of a Sampler Engine class, SamplerGUI class, keep in mind that your sampler should be usable without a GUI or with a GUI.
Integrate the waveform visualizer with trim bars...
